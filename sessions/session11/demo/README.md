# 🎨 CSS Pseudo-elements

## 📑 Index

- **CSS Pseudo-elements:**

  - `::before`
  - `::after`
  - `::selection`
  - `::marker`
  - `::placeholder`
  - `::backdrop`
  - `::first-letter`

- **Deploy / Hosting (GitHub + Vercel)**
  - Hosting refers to where your project is published and accessible online.
  - Traditionally, deployment involved manually uploading files to a server.
  - Using GitHub with platforms like GitHub Pages or Vercel automates this process.
  - Every push triggers an automatic update of the live site (**Continuous Deployment**).
  - This process is called **Continuous Integration (CI)**: the platform automatically prepares and updates your project every time you make a change.
  - Hosting platform: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## 🚀 Advanced

- Combine pseudo-elements with `content`, `position`, and `z-index` to create decorative elements without adding extra HTML.
- Use `::before` and `::after` for badges, custom shapes, overlays, and dynamic UI effects.
- Experiment with transitions or animations applied directly to pseudo-elements for richer interactions.

> [!TIP]
> Pseudo-elements let you add **virtual elements** to the DOM — perfect for styling without polluting your HTML structure.
